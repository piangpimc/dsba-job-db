# DSBA Job Search Database 💼📊

Welcome to the **DSBA Job Search** platform — a collaborative tool designed to help students in the DSBA (Data Science and Business Analytics) program share their job hunting experiences and interview questions.

🌐 **Website**: [dsba-job-search.streamlit.app](https://dsba-job-search.streamlit.app/)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this project is to create a centralized, crowdsourced database of job interview questions and job search insights **from DSBA students, for DSBA students**.

To keep things fair and valuable for everyone, access to the database is **restricted** — you can only view the entries **if you contribute** something yourself.

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Submit your job search experience via the form.
2. Once your entry is submitted, you'll be granted access to view others' submissions.
3. Browse interview questions, company names, roles, and more — all contributed by your peers.

## 💡 Features

- ✅ Anonymous submissions
- ✅ Instant access after contributing
- ✅ Filterable and searchable entries
- ✅ Clean UI with Streamlit
